Educational Refactoring Artefact Testing
~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=

This test activity is split into 3 tasks that you need to complete. (And 1 stretch task)
You can complete these tasks all at the same time or split them up as you like.
You can complete them in any order.

There is no right or wrong answer so do it whichever way you feel.

Before participating open the form link and start filling it in.

~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=

Task 1:

Create a function that will take in a STRING and an INTEGER.
The function should return the string repeated a number of times, equal to the integer.


Example Data of Task 1:

If the data passed in is ("I'm the string!", 4)
The returned output is expected as ("I'm the string!I'm the string!I'm the string!I'm the string!")

Task 2:

Create a function that will take in a STRING.
The function should reverse the order of the words in the string and return the new string.

Example Data of Task 2:

If the data passed in is ("I'm the string!")
The returned output is expected as ("string! the I'm")

Task 3:

Create a function that will take in a STRING.
The function should alternate the case of each character in the string. 
Upper to lower, Lower to Upper etc.

Example Data of Task 3:

If the data passed in is ("I'm the string!")
The returned output is expected as ("i'M THE STRING!")

(Numerical values are unaffected, i.e. "1234" = "1234" & "a1b2" = "A1B2")

(Stretch) Task 4:

Attempt this if you completed all of the previous tasks quickly.

Create a function that will take in a STRING and an ARRAY of CHARACTERS.
The function should remove any characters from the string that match the characters given in the array.
The new string should then be returned.

Example Data of Task 4:

If the data passed in is ("I'm the string!", [a, e, i, o, u])
The returned output is expected as ("'m th strng!")
